# Introduction to WorldQuant BRAIN

## What is BRAIN?

**Anytime Anywhere**

Use web-based simulator created by WorldQuant that anyone can access anytime by simply registering online.

**Build alphas**

Employ our large collection of data fields and operators to create alphas.

> Alphas are mathematical models that seek to predict the futureprice movements of various financial instruments.

**Backtest alphas**

Run simulations using historical data, andgenerate a summary of past performanceof your model to measure its effectiveness.

### “Simulate“ - Navigation Bar

——where you write out your financial model

You can click the Simulate button to make your first simple attempt.

- Chart：Then, on the right side, there is **a profit and loss chart**. It shows what what could have happened If I consistently applied the model on the left to buy and sell stocks over this time period. This what we called backtest.
- Summary：A bunch of statistics that give you objective criteria that tell you how good the back test is.

## Developing Quantitative Ideas with BRAIN

One method of developing quant ideas：

1. Collect data and information：BRAIN has one of the world's largest collection of data fields relevant to building alphas on stocks.
2. Come up with an idea or hypothesis：The BRAIN Research Consultant program
3. Translate idea into mathematical model：⬆️
4. Backtest the idea on historical data：BRAIN has historical stock data that allows you to simulate past performance with a click of a button.
5. Check for robustness：BRAIN also generates multiple objective parameters to evaluate backtests such as Sharpe.

## How to Become a Research Consultant

From **User** to **Consultant**

- User needs to score **10,000 points** in the **WorldQuant Challenge** to become eligible to be a consultant
- **Points** can be earned by **submitting alphas** that meet our **thresholds**
  
- **Rule of thumb:** You can earn 10,000 points by submitting 5 to 10 alphas
  on 5 or more distinct days
  - You earn points every day you submit alphas
  - Maximum points that can be earned in a single day: 2,000
  - Usually, these points can be earned by submitting 1 to 2 alphas in a day
